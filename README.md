# WikipediaPovertyMapping
This repository contains the implementation of our _KDD2019_ paper: [__Predicting Economic Development Using Geolocated Wikipedia Articles__](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3292500.3330784).

</p>

Here, we present the code for parsing a Wikipedia xml dump into its constituent geolocated articles,
converting them to human readable format, training a Doc2Vec model over them, and building and training
a model using the Doc2Vec embeddings to predict poverty via (1) the 10 closest articles and (2) the articles
as well as Nightlights imagery.


We will be updating and cleaning the code for distribution and can field concerns or requests at esheehan@stanford.edu or chenlin@stanford.edu.

# Predicting Economic Development Using Geolocated Wikipedia Articles

## Downloading and Parsing Geolocated Articles
will be updated soon!


## Training Doc2Vec on Geolocated Articles
We use [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html) doc2vec packege for training the Doc2Vec model. To train the Doc2Vec model on geolocated articles, run:

```
python Doc2Vec/Doc2Vec_modules/train_doc2vec.py
```

## Socioeconomic Data
Our ground truth dataset consists of data on asset ownership from the Demographic and Health Surveys [DHS](https://www.dhsprogram.com/) and [Afrobarometer](http://http://afrobarometer.org). DHS is a set of nationally representative household surveys conducted periodically in
most developing countries, spanning 31 African countries. Afrobarometer (Round 6) is a survey across 36 countries in
Africa, assessing various aspects of welfare, education, and infrastructure quality.

## Nightlight Imagery Dataset
We use high-resolution night-time imagery from VIIRS [Elvidge et al., 2017]. Each of the imagery is of shape (255, 255). For each point in the AWI data that we train on, we obtain a nightlights image centered on its coordinate. The size of these
images was set to (5 km Ã— 5 km) due to the (maximum) 5km noise that each location has. 

## Models
We provide the code for Wikipedia Embedding Model and Multi-modal Model in
```
models/
```
### Wikipedia Embedding Model
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/ermongroup/WikipediaPovertyMapping/blob/master/images/Wikipedia_Embedding_Model.png" width="500"/>
</p>
	
To train the Wikipedia embedding model, run

```
python models/comboModel.py
```
The model will evaluate the results on Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda.
### Wikipedia Nightlight Multi-modal Model
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/ermongroup/WikipediaPovertyMapping/blob/master/images/Multi-modal_Architecture.png" width="500"/>
</p>

To train the multi-modal model, run

```
python models/multi_Doc2VecModel.py
```
The model will evaluate the results on Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda.

## Results
When paired with nightlights satellite imagery,
our method outperforms all previously published benchmarks for
this prediction task, indicating the potential of Wikipedia to inform
both research in the social sciences and future policy decisions.

Here is an example:
On the left is the ground truth values of 1074 data points averaged on Admin 2 Level for Tanzania. On the right is the Wikipedia Embedding Model predicted values averaged on Admin 2 level for a model trained on Ghana and tested on Tanzania (r2 = 0.52). The resulting predictions show that the model is capable of generalizing across national boundaries.
