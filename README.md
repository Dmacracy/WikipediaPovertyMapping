# WikipediaPovertyMapping
Implementation of Geolocated Articles Processing and Poverty Mapping

Here, we present the code for parsing a Wikipedia xml dump into its constituent geolocated articles,
converting them to human readable format, training a Doc2Vec model over them, and building and training
a model using the Doc2Vec embeddings to predict poverty via (1) the 10 closest articles and (2) the articles
as well as Nightlights imagery.

We will be updating and cleaning the code for distribution and can field and concerns or requests at esheehan@stanford.edu.
